![Preview Image](./preview_meta_data.png)

This tic-tac-toe contract provides an example of building a game on WAX, complete with secure use of random values to determine game outcomes.

This will guide you how to make the Tictactoe game contract which run on Wax blockchain. Logic of the tictactoe game follow the eosio sample at Tic-tac-toe Game EOS tutorial, but we'll add more logic that support randomize the first turner and random game move if playing with bot.

3. **Objective**: The goal is to be the first to create a row of three of your marks (X's or O's) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. **Gameplay**: Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square on the grid.

5. **Turns**: The player assigned "X" usually goes first, followed by the player assigned "O". Players continue taking turns until one player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a tie).

6. **Winning**: A player wins the game if they successfully create a row of three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, they declare "Tic Tac Toe!" and are declared the winner.

7. **Ties**: If all squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
